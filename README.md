# Train bottlenecks

Displays the throughput density over tracks by measuring how many trains cross that track in a certain timeframe.

This mod is in early development stage, therefore can be unstable.

Released versions are tested and should functionally work.

# Known issues

-   Maps with a lot of surfaces and/or a lot of trains may cause lag
-   Rendering the overlay multiple times may cause lag

# Collaborations welcome

-   Start a discussion with your ideas
-   Open a pull request on Github
-   Report issues/bugs under discussions

# Roadmap

-   Update trail graphics to connect properly
-   Improve visualization to indicate stopped train waiting time in block (currently only in segment)
-   Optimize performance by throttling updates per tick in order to prevent lag
-   Add option to choose vizualization time to live
-   Idea: Graph with throughput in past timeframe for selected area
-   Idea: GUI with top X bottlenecks & pareto graph with average train stopped waiting time
-   Idea: Track average waiting time at stations
