# Train bottlenecks

Displays the throughput density over tracks by measuring how many trains cross that track in a certain timeframe.

This mod is in early development stage, therefore can be unstable.

Released versions are tested and should functionally work.

# Known issues

-   Maps with a lot of surfaces and/or a lot of trains may cause lag
-   Rendering the overlay multiple times may cause lag

# Collaborations welcome

-   Start a discussion with your ideas
-   Open a pull request on Github
-   Report issues/bugs under discussions
